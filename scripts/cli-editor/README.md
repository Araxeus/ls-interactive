# Command Line Editor Scripts

The scripts in this folder enable you to choose a text editor to use for editing files in the command line.

All the scripts use `micro` as the default editor.
If you want to use a different editor, replace `micro` with the name of your editor in the scripts. (for example, `vim` or `nano` or `code`)
